Provides a simple tidyup to address data entered by customer.

For instance:<br/>
'ann other' becomes 'Ann Other'<br/>
'one test street' becomes 'One Test Street'<br/>

The tidyup is only applied when address is inserted into the database.<br/>
Afterwards the customer, or administrator, can change it in anyway they want.
