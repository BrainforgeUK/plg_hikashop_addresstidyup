Provides a simple tidyup to address data entered by customer.

For instance:
'ann other' becomes 'Ann Other'
'one test street' becomes 'One Test Street'

The tidyup is only applied when address is inserted into the database.
Afterwards the customer, or administrator, can change it in anyway they want.
